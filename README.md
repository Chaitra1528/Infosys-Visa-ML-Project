# Infosys Visa Prediction Project

## Milestone 3 – Model Building
In this milestone, visa application data was analyzed and preprocessed. 
A machine learning model (Random Forest) was trained using applicant age and number of documents submitted to predict visa approval status. 
The trained model was saved for deployment.

## Milestone 4 – Web App Development
In this milestone, the trained model was deployed as a web application using Streamlit.
The application takes user inputs and predicts whether the visa is likely to be approved or rejected.
The backend model and frontend interface were successfully connected.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Outcome
A working machine learning–based visa prediction web application.
